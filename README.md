# Builder pattern

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Setup

To execute the project, it will be necessary to install the dependencies by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn install
```

To execute the project it is necessary to transpile the Typescript code to JavaScript. To do this, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn tsc
```

### Use

To execute the project already transpiled into JavaScript, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn start
```
